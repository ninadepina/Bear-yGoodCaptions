# 👋🏼 CC for 'THE BEAR'
Marie is Deaf (with a capital 'D', which means she doesn't see her deafness as a disability). She was born deaf, and her native language is Dutch Sign Language. You'll understand that Marie experiences difficulty with tasks that heavily rely on sound.

Marie experiences a significant loss of nuance while watching a movie or a documentary. Although many films offer closed captions, they are often too neutral. How might we enhance closed captions(cc) to provide Marie with a more meaningful viewing experience?
