Do you watch movies/series?
```plaintext
'I love watching TV series and shows, but I'm not really into movies.'
```

What series do you watch?
```plaintext
'I just finished watching the last part of The Last of Us. I'm also watching Succession and I'm in the middle of 
My Big Little Lies. But I also watch (bad) Dutch TV shows/series.'
```

What do you think of closed captions of these streaming services, and which one has the best?
```plaintext
'That's a good question. I think Netflix. Let me start with the worst example: Dutch TV. The captions are always 
a surprise to me. In some series there are overlapping conversations between people, but then in the same serie 
but in another episode, it's clearly laid out. So why is it inconsistent? Also, names aren't clearly written out.

The captions don't indicate who is speaking, and environmental sounds aren't taken into account. You might hear 
gunshots, but it's not reflected in the captions. So when I see characters reacting to something, I don't know 
what they're reacting to. I often have to guess who's speaking. Sometimes, establishing shots are shown, but then 
I have no idea who's speaking.

I recently read an article on the NOS website that said the Netherlands isn't yet required to provide more 
context in these kinds of programs. Many American streaming services, such as Disney, are doing okay, but in my 
experience, Netflix is the best. I prefer to watch their shows with English subtitles. But when you switch to a 
different language, there are no closed captions. For example, it might say 'suspenseful music', but how do I 
know it's suspenseful (it's too abstract)?

There's also a cooking show called 'High on the Hog' it's about an African cooking in America, and it's very well 
subtitled. You can see a man emotionally recounting the history of slavery. When he speaks, the subtitles indicate 
when he's crying or when his voice is shaky, so you know what he's feeling. Stranger Things is also good, but 
sometimes they go overboard. For example, they show explosions that are already visible on the screen.

For spoken languages, there's a lot of nuance in how things are said and what emotions are conveyed, so there's 
much more information in spoken language than can be conveyed in subtitles.'

What if colors where used to emphasize emotions?
```plaintext
'In the past VPRO used to have colored subtitles where each person was assigned a specific color at the beginning 
of the series. However, that suddenly disappeared. The disadvantage of color theory is that, for example, red in 
Western culture is seen as 'danger' but in Asian culture it has a much more positive association for people. So, 
you would have to take that into account. I think using colors to convey emotions is difficult, because color 
associations vary for each person.'
```

And using different fonts to emphasize emotions?
```plaintext
'It's possible, it's fun to play around with and see if it works. I love reading, but I can imagine that if 
something is written in all caps, I perceive it as yelling.'
```

What series/show/scene would you like us to use for prototyping?
```plaintext
'I watched something wrong recently. The Thousand Pound Sisters, don't watch it LOL. I'd like a scene where 
something is happening, otherwise it's boring. Um maybe, Disney's 'The Bear'. It's a great series, fairly short, 
about a chef in Chicago taking over his brother's restaurant. It consists of a lot of arguments and a lot of 
other situations. There's also certain music that apparently raises the stress level (friends told me), but that 
doesn't affect me.. Lots of arguments, lots of stress, lots happening.'
```

What if there are distinctions between different types of music?
```plaintext
'Music in general, is very abstract to me. When I listen to someone playing an emotional song on the guitar, I 
may not fully comprehend the depth of feeling conveyed through the music, but I can appreciate the fact that it 
is an emotional piece. I was raised as a conscious listener. My parents are hearing, and as a child, I was 
never conscious of the sounds I made. Slamming doors, throwing pots. My parents instilled in me an awareness of 
the sounds around me, and I learned to be conscious of the noises I made. As a result, I tend to be mindful of 
loud sounds and their potential impact on those around me.

I am aware that sounds evoke certain emotions. A while ago, my grandfather passed away, and when they were 
discussing the funeral, everyone suddenly started crying. I had no idea why, until they told me they were 
choosing the music. That was when I became aware that music can evoke such emotions.

At another funeral, I was given the lyrics to songs played at a funeral and found them to be very sad. However, I 
later learned that the songs were actually meant to convey a sense of happiness. This experience helped me to 
understand that lyrics and melody can be quite distinct from one another.'
```

And what would you think of experiencing music through vibrations?
```plaintext
'While I appreciate the value of feeling music through vibrations, I believe there is more to music than just the 
physical sensations it produces. Vibrations can provide a useful sensory input when combined with other elements 
of music, but they don't capture the full range of emotions and experiences that music can offer.'
