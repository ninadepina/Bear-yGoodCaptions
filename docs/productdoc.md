# Bear-y Good Captions: Week 1
Marie is Deaf (with a capital 'D', which means she doesn't see her deafness as a disability). She was born deaf, and her native language is Dutch Sign Language. You'll understand that Marie experiences difficulty with tasks that heavily rely on sound.

Marie experiences a significant loss of nuance while watching a movie or a documentary. Although many films offer closed captions, they are often too neutral. How might we enhance closed captions(cc) to provide Marie with a more meaningful viewing experience?

## Assumptions
- Difficulty experiencing the emotions conveyed by a film/series (as music is a significant component in that).
- Difficulty discerning who is saying what when multiple people are speaking.
- Difficulty discerning the tone of the speaker (especially when the speaker is not on screen).

## First meeting with Marie
I met Marie at the end of the first week of the course. She was very open about her deafness and her life with it. Additionally, she expressed her thoughts on closed captions, conveying that she often perceives them to be too bland and devoid of emotion. She was very specific in her likes and dislikes, and I was able to take notes on her preferences. She wished to see more depth in captions, including the name of the speaker, their tone and an indication on where the background noise is coming from. But note that excessive captions is also a thing. For example, when a person is speaking and visible on screen, it is unnecessary to display their name.

Some insights I gained from the meeting (read the full transcript [here](https://github.com/ninadepina/Bear-yGoodCaptions/blob/main/docs/interview.md)):
```plaintext
Do you watch movies/series?
-
'I love watching TV series and shows, but I'm not really into movies.'



What series do you watch?
-
'I just finished watching the last part of The Last of Us. I'm also watching Succession and I'm in the middle of My Big Little Lies. But I also watch (bad) Dutch TV shows/series.'



What do you think of closed captions of these streaming services, and which one has the best?
-
'That's a good question. I think Netflix. Let me start with the worst example: Dutch TV. The captions are always a surprise to me. In some series there are overlapping conversations between people, but then in the same serie but in another episode, it's clearly laid out. So why is it inconsistent? Also, names aren't clearly written out. 

The captions don't indicate who is speaking, and environmental sounds aren't taken into account. You might hear gunshots, but it's not reflected in the captions. So when I see characters reacting to something, I don't know what they're reacting to. I often have to guess who's speaking. Sometimes, establishing shots are shown, but then I have no idea who's speaking.

I recently read an article on the NOS website that said the Netherlands isn't yet required to provide more context in these kinds of programs. Many American streaming services, such as Disney, are doing okay, but in my experience, Netflix is the best. I prefer to watch their shows with English subtitles. But when you switch to a different language, there are no closed captions. For example, it might say 'suspenseful music', but how do I know it's suspenseful (it's too abstract)?

There's also a cooking show called 'High on the Hog' it's about an African cooking in America, and it's very well subtitled. You can see a man emotionally recounting the history of slavery. When he speaks, the subtitles indicate when he's crying or when his voice is shaky, so you know what he's feeling. Stranger Things is also good, but sometimes they go overboard. For example, they show explosions that are already visible on the screen.

For spoken languages, there's a lot of nuance in how things are said and what emotions are conveyed, so there's much more information in spoken language than can be conveyed in subtitles.'



What if colors where used to emphasize emotions?
-
'In the past VPRO used to have colored subtitles where each person was assigned a specific color at the beginning of the series. However, that suddenly disappeared. The disadvantage of color theory is that, for example, red in Western culture is seen as 'danger' but in Asian culture it has a much more positive association for people. So, you would have to take that into account. I think using colors to convey emotions is difficult, because color associations vary for each person.'



And using different fonts to emphasize emotions?
-
'It's possible, it's fun to play around with and see if it works. I love reading, but I can imagine that if something is written in all caps, I perceive it as yelling.'
```

## Concept
I noticed that I was getting a bit stuck when trying to come up with a concept. This was mainly because I wanted to create something that Marie could actually use after this project, which is not entirely feasible.

In the end, I chose to work with a scene from the series 'The Bear'. The idea is to:
- Add a visible indication of where background noises are coming from.
- Improve closed captions.
    - Add names when the speaker is not visible on screen.
    - Provide more specific explanations of background noises.
    - Add speech tone (stuttering, etc.).
